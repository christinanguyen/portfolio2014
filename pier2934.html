<div class="text">
	<p>Pier 2934 is a Cajun seafood restaurant located in Georgetown, D.C. Because of its location, the owner desired to have a more refined design approach than what most Cajun restaurants around there go for.</p>
	<p>I designed the logo, designed and developed the website, and the menu. I went in a direction that utilized gritty textures and striking photography that were associated with Cajun cuisine and seafood.</p>
