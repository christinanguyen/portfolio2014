<div class="text">
	<p>CareersAtHCA is Hospital Corporation of America's central website that connects them and career-seeking individuals. Not only does it let a visitor search for jobs, but they could also view facility information, news associated with that facility, and demographics to help them make a more informed decision about their career.</p>
	<p>I was a part of the UX process, charting userflows along with wireframes, and also shared my design ideas internally. I wanted to modernize, streamline, and generally lighten their current design.</p>
