	<p>Lazarus Gaming was a StarCraft 2 professional team that was started by a guy who wanted to make a team with friends. Being an avid gamer myself, I was more than excited to work for a pro team! He hired me to do all design work, from the logo to the website. I wanted to make the team's identity to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the more famous and well-funded teams.</p>
