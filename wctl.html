</div>

<div class="text">
	<p>We Come to Learn develops early education games and apps. While anyone could pick up the apps to use, they're focused for use in the classroom, thus includes a robust suite of features such as analytics, multiple accounts for children, a rewards system, among others.</p>
	<p>I designed the logo and identity, website (including wireframes), and preview videos. The design was inspired by the games' illustrations.</p>
