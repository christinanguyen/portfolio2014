		<p>We Come to Learn develops early education games and apps. While anyone could pick up the apps to use, they're focused for use in the classroom, thus includes a robust suite of features such as analytics, multiple accounts for children, a rewards system, among others.</p>
		<p>I designed the logo and identity, website, and preview videos. The design was inspired by the whimsical illustrations.</p>
