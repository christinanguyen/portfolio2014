<div class="text">
	<p>Godwin Theatre is part of Mills E. Godwin High School and recognized at a state and national level. They needed an update to their current design since their students need a place to download documents and see upcoming events. It was also vital to get adults in the community involved and/or donate to their troupe.</p>
	<p>I did the wireframing, design, the front-end of the development, and some back-end, creating a custom WordPress theme so they can easily manage the content. The website was done pro-bono.</p>
