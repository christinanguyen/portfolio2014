<div class="text">
	<p>Chloe's Desserts is a bakery started by the girlfriend of a good friend of mine. She wanted to go for a design reminiscent of the 1950's &endash; 1960's while being humble with a lot of love. I designed both the logo and the single-page website, going for whimsical typography and patterns.</p>
